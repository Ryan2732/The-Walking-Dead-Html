<h1>The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series</h1>

<p>The game of the year in 2012, The Walking Dead by Telltale Games was a very simple point-and-click game, but it told a beautiful and astounding story. It told the story of a man named Lee who, at the start of a zombie apocolypse, met a little girl named Clementine who had lost her parents. He took it upon himself to look after her and that was the start of an inseparable bond between the two. They form a group with other survivors that they meet, and along with that group came drama and problems, but no matter what happened with the others, Lee and Clementine had each other throughout it all. They kept each other going and gave each other a reason to keep fighting.</p>

<h2>The Commitment</h2>

<p2>The Walking Dead was Telltale's breakout game, and therefore, it exposed their style of releasing games to the entire gaming community. Telltale released The Walking Dead as an episodic game, releasing one episode (lasting 2-3 hours) every couple of months. Within the first season, the first episode released in April of 2012 and the fifth and final episode released in November of 2012, meaning the fan base, including myself, was committed to the game and grew attached to the characters, especially Lee and Clementine. This time allowed the players to become more invested, and that meant the more emotion that was expressed whenever something bad happened to one of the characters they cared about.</p2>
